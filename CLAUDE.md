# CLAUDE.md — bib-frontend

The **10X Workspace** (staff) and, later, the **client portal** — the browser half of BiB.
The backend is a separate service in a separate repo (`../bib-backend`); read its
`CLAUDE.md` for the architecture those APIs come from. This file is the rules for this app.

## The one rule: the API's shapes are generated, never retyped

`src/lib/api/schema.d.ts` is generated from the backend's `/openapi.json`, which is itself
generated from the zod schemas that validate the requests. So every request and response
shape has **exactly one definition, in the backend**.

```bash
npm run api:generate    # backend must be running on :8080
```

- **Never hand-write an API type.** Import it from `@/lib/api/client`, which re-exports off
  the generated schema. A renamed backend field then becomes a compile error here instead of
  an `undefined` at runtime.
- **Never edit `schema.d.ts`.** It is overwritten, and it is gitignored from linting for the
  same reason.
- Regenerate after any backend API change. It is one command, deliberately.

## The API is a different origin. Always.

Not a local quirk — the arrangement in every environment. Consequences, all deliberate:

- **No dev proxy / rewrite.** A proxy would make local development work under rules that
  apply nowhere else (same-origin, no preflight, no cookie policy), so the first environment
  to exercise the real rules would be production.
- **`credentials: "include"` on every call**, set once in `client.ts`. Without it the browser
  withholds the session cookie cross-origin and every authenticated request silently becomes
  anonymous.
- **This app's origin must be in the backend's `BIB_CORS_ORIGINS`**, or the browser discards
  responses before this code sees them.

## The session is not ours to hold

The API sets an **httpOnly** cookie. No script can read it — including this one. So there is
no token in `localStorage`, no auth header to attach, and no "log out" that clears a client
store: sign-out is a call the server acts on. If you find yourself wanting to read the
session, the answer is `GET /api/v1/auth/me`.

A 401 mid-session is ordinary, not an error to display: the session expired, was revoked, or
the user's membership was deactivated (the API re-checks it on every request). Route to
`/login`.

## What the API tells the user, we show

Failures come back in one envelope: `{ error: { code, message, reason? } }`. Show `message`.
Do not improve on it — several messages are deliberately vague because the API must not
confirm who holds an account, and a friendlier local rewrite would leak exactly what the
backend refused to.

## Styling

Tokens in `src/app/globals.css`, used by name. No hardcoded hex values in components. This
is the smallest thing worth calling a design system; grow it when a real screen needs more,
not before.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev            # :3000, expects the API on :8080
npm run api:generate   # regenerate the typed client from the running API
npm run check          # typecheck + lint — run before every push
npm run build
```
